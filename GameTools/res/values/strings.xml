    <string name="LDS_GH_POP_GAME_LAUNCHER_TOS_PART48_LEGALPHASE_US">If, however, subsection (vi) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Samsung shall be entitled to arbitrate the dispute.

13. General Terms
13.1 \u0009Choice of Law.  These TOS, including all revisions and amendments thereto, are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, without regard to its conflict or choice of law principles.
13.2\u0009Arbitration.  By using the SERVICE, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (i) any claim, dispute or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against any Samsung entity, the officers, directors, agents and employees of any Samsung entity (the “Samsung Entity(ies)”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the SERVICE or the determination of the scope or applicability of this clause, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (ii) this clause is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (iii) the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York; (iv) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of the TOS and any other agreements referenced herein that you have agreed to in connection with the SERVICE; (v) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (vi) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Samsung Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; and you will not file or participate in a class action against us; (vii) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Samsung Entity; (viii) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Samsung Entity exceed One Hundred Twenty-Five US Dollars (US$125), and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Samsung agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator.  In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Samsung will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost prohibitive; and (ix) with the exception of subsection (vi) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.  If, however, subsection (vi) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Samsung shall be entitled to arbitrate the dispute.  For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com.
13.3 \u0009Severability.  If any term or provision of this TOS is held to be void or unenforceable by any judicial or administrative authority, such determination shall not affect the validity of enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this TOS.  The remaining provisions of this TOS shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms.
13.4 \u0009Survival.  Sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the TOS, and any other provision that by its nature should continue to be in effect, shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the TOS, and shall remain valid and binding.
13.5 \u0009Headings.  The headings contained in the TOS are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the TOS.
13.6 \u0009No Waiver.  The failure of Samsung to enforce at any time any of the provisions of the TOS, or the failure by Samsung to require at any time performance by you of any of the provisions of the TOS, shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the right of Samsung to enforce such provision thereafter.  The express waiver by Samsung of any provision, condition or requirement of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.
13.7\u0009Third Party Sites.  We may offer links or other materials on the SERVICE which allow you to browse or be redirected to a third party’s website, such as a social networking platform.  We are not associated with, endorsing, or responsible for the services, websites, or content of these third parties.  If you have any questions about these other companies’ practices, you should review their terms of use and other policies.
